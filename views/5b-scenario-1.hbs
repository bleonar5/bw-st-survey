        Scenario 1
      </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You are a member of an equipment maintenance team responsible for 12 high tech manufacturing machines.</li>
          <li>Your five-person team has experts in many areas, including mechanical, electrical, &amp; hydraulic systems.</li>
          <li>You are the only member of your team with experience in the structural mechanics of the machines.</li>
          <li>One of the machines was struck by a forklift while being prepared for an important production run.</li>
          <li>The company owner quickly pulls your team together and asks if it is ok to run the machine. You are the last one to arrive at the meeting.</li>
          <li>Apparently, the team feels that there was not any visible damage to the machine and it can be used safely.  They tell you that they have looked it over and didnâ€™t see any damage.</li>
