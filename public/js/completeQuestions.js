console.log('I am Complete Questions');

/* 
This function will run a loop that:
(0) Uses the getQuestions function to get the IDs of each question
(1) Checks each of the radio questions and then marks each one as complete (Checking first-radio-box)
(2) If the page has non-radio questions, it will mark the questions 'no' so that user/tester can proceed
