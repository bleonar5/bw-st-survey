There was an issue pushing to github after changing the filenames in the models.
The filenames initally had a lowercase starting letter (e.g. answer.js).
I changed this to uppercase (Answer.js) and pushed to github
github did not update the filename and Heroku crashed
The app continued to work on localhost though.
